Hello, I'm Nathan Schleef

I'm a technical writer focused on documentation, copyediting, and similar
I'm fairly new to collaborative projects, but have a good amount of experience working with docs, file systems, and even a hint of Python, HTML, and Godot.
My main goal here is to learn, feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or advice!
